### 🎥 Experimental Setup

<p align="left">
  Four synchronized and calibrated high-speed cameras, capturing at an impressive 16,000 frames per second (fps), record flying insects in real-time. For context, the wingbeat frequency here is around 200 Hz, allowing us to capture intricate details of wing and body dynamics.

**The Method**
* We developed a **robust 3D tracking system** to capture specific **feature points** on a fly’s **wings and body**.
* We employed a **multi-camera 2D tracker** powered by an **ensemble of deep learning models**, and aggregated **multi-view detections** into accurate 3D reconstructions.
* We Derived the **fly’s geometry**: **body orientation** and **wing angles** using these tracked points.

**Main challenges**
* Working with a **small, custom dataset**, leaving **no off-the-shelf solutions** available.
* Handling **multiple self-occlusions**, where **feature points may be unseen** in many frames, and determining **which cameras should be used** at any given time.
* Ensuring **robustness and outlier-free** analysis for **every** recorded movie.

**On the left side**, you’ll see the **hand-picked feature points**, automatically detected across all four views. This detection is powered by a **trained ensemble of deep neural networks**, which **identifies points** in each view independently. These 2D detections from multiple views are later **aggregated using novel optimization technics into optimal 3D points**.

**On the right side**, you’ll observe the **reconstructed 3D points**, enhanced with additional annotations:

* The **green plane** represents the **'stroke plane'**: the imaginary plane through which the insect's wings move during each wingbeat.
* The **three arrows** in the center define the insect's **internal 3D coordinate system**.
* Each wing features **two arrows** representing the **chord and span** (x and y axes) of the wing's coordinate system.

* The **static movie** provides an interactive summary of the flight event, visualizing the positions of the wingtips and the center of mass for each frame. Additionally, it depicts the orientation of the fly at every wingbeat (~70 frames), represented as a cross marker.
* The **dynamic movie** offers an interactive simulation of the flight dynamics across all frames, showcasing the tracked 3D points, the fly's internal moving coordinate system, and the coordinate systems of each wing, represented by the chord and span of the wings

## Basic Pose Estimation CNN Architecture

The input to the pose estimation CNN is a 5-channel image comprising three temporal channels (corresponding to frames at -7, 0, and +7 relative to the current frame) and two binary segmentation masks, which act as an attention mechanism to address left-right wing ambiguity. The output is a multi-channel image containing C Gaussian heatmaps, each representing a distinct feature point.
